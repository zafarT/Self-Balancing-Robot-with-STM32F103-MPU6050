# Self-Balancing-Robot-with-STM32F103-MPU6050
This repository contains the firmware and documentation for a self-balancing two-wheeled robot built using the STM32F103 microcontroller and the MPU6050 IMU sensor. The project demonstrates real-time control, sensor fusion, and PID-based stabilization on a resource-constrained embedded platform.
